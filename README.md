RESTFul API with which users can add/remove, search by id, title, author, and borrow/return books. 

### Technology stack
Java + Spring Boot + Maven + H2 database

- Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/novojitsaha/library_mgmt_system.git``` in your preferred directory.
- Ensure Java is installed and JAVA_HOME variable is added in your operating system's environment variables. 
- Ensure the Java version in the ```pom.xml``` file matches the Java version in your JAVA_HOME.
- Open terminal in your project root directory and enter ```./mvnw clean package javadoc:javadoc```. Wait for the build to be finished.
- Change directory to ```target``` folder with ```cd target```.

### Javadocs

Javadocs for this project is live at [https://novojitsaha.github.io/library_mgmt_system](https://novojitsaha.github.io/library_mgmt_system).
You can also view the javadocs locally by opening ```./docs/apidocs/index.html``` in your favourite browser. 

### Database
The application will save the data in your home folder in a file called ```library_db```. This ensures that data persists between application restarts. If you'd like to change the location where data is saved, please change the value of ```spring.datasource.url``` located in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```.
This project requires simple database queries and therefore H2 database was deemed appropriate for its use case. Since itâ€™s an embedded database, no external database server needs to be set up. 

### Design Patterns
A controller-service-repository pattern is used to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. All the API endpoints are defined in the ```LibraryController``` Class, while ```LibraryService``` Class handles the business logic and ```BookRepository``` Class integrates the H2 database.
